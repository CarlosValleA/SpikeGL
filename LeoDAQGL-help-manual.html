      <p align="left">LeoDAQGL 	is a high speed multi-channel data acquisition application for 	Windows computers running on National Instruments DAQ hardware.   	The primary focus of the program is to acquire analog input (AI) 	voltage samples from the DAQ hardware.  Additionally, the software 	supports passing incoming AI channels back out to AO, as well as 	support for a specific custom external multiplexer circuit based on 	the Intan RHA 1016 integrated circuit (visit <a href="http://www.intantech.com/">http://www.intantech.com</a> for 	more details on this IC). </p>
      <p align="left"><br />
          </p>
      <p align="left">Key 	features of this application are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support 		for most NI DAQ boards</li>
        <li>Tested 		with sampling rates exceeding 1.6 mega-samples/second (aggregate 		for all channels) </li>
        <li>High 		performance real-time graphing using OpenGL</li>
        <li>Support 		for the custom Intan RHA 1016 external MUX</li>
        <li>Analog 		Output (AO) passthru support</li>
        <li>Integration 		with the StimulateOpenGL_II program</li>
        <li>PAR2 		redundancy and SHA1 verification of datafiles</li>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"> <strong><em>AI 60 Demux</em></strong> – The acquisition will be a 60-channel Intan/MUX acquisition.  It 	will use 4 AI channels on the DAQ board,  each of which is sampled 	simultaneously at 444 kHz.  Each channel multiplexes 15 electrode 	channels in time, thus the electrodes are sampled at 29.63 kHz per 	channel.  See the file  '<em>Leonardo-RetinaMux-Manial.pdf</em>' 	for more information.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong><em>AI 120 Demux</em></strong> – Identical to the AI 60 Demux scheme above, but this mechanism 	uses more Intan chips to yield 120 multiplexed channels coming in on 	8 simultaneous AI channels on the DAQ board.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong><em>Straight AI</em></strong> – No external MUX hardware is used.  Channels are graphed and 	saved verbatim without any de-multiplexing being applied.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong><em>JFRC/Intan 32 Headstage</em></strong> – This mode is similar to the AI60Demux mode, however the acquisition will be a 32-channel Intan/MUX acquisition.  It will use 2 AI channels of the DAQ board each of which is sampled simultaneously at a variable (user-settable) sampling rate.  An external clock is used to time the acquisition on PFI2.  The order of the channels coming in off hardware are such that channels 0-15 come from the first AI channel and 16-31 come from the second AI channel.</p>

          <p align="left"><em>Nota 	bene #2: While passing data coming in from AI back out to AO may be 	useful in some situations, it should be bourn in mind that AO output 	signals will be delayed in time with respect to their corresponding 	AI inputs.  This is because DAQ AI and AO are buffered on the board 	and in software. This manifests itself as a time delay when writing 	samples that arrive from AI back out to AO.  In short, there is a 	delay between when a data sample physically arrives to an AI 	channel, is buffered to memory on the DAQ board, is read by the 	software, and is eventually written back out to the AO hardware 	again. </em></p>

  <p align="left">The graphs window has a toolbar with various buttons and widgets for controlling the graph properties.</p>

  <p align="left"><U><strong>Channel </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> This is basically the name of the graph.  The naming convention is such that AI or AUX channels indicate real analog input channels, whereas Ixx_Cyy style names indicate a demultiplexed Intan/MUX channel.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p align="left"><U><strong>Pause Button </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Toggles the graph pause state.  When paused, all the graphs are frozen but data is still streamed to disk.  Pausing the graphs is useful in some situations when closely studying the input signals, etc.</p>

  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Maximize/Restore Button </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Maximize the currently selected graph so that it is the only one displayed. If it is already maximized, restores it back to unmaximized mode.  This is useful when closely studying a particular graph.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Seconds and Yscale </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Specifies the horizontal (time, seconds) and vertical scale of the currently selected graph.  Modifying these values affects the scale of the graph in the X and Y dimensions, respectively.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Color</strong></U> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Specify the currently selected graph's foreground color.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Apply-All Button </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Applies the currently selected graph's Seconds, YScale and Color setting to all the graphs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Downsample (1 KHz) </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Checking this will downsample the graphs display to 1 KHz (if and only if the acquisition is running at &gt; 1 KHz per channel). This option is useful in order to reduce the overhead associated with graphing the AI data, since the graphs themselves are often small and lack the screen resolution to display data finer than 1 KHz anyway. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Filter &lt;300Hz </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> If checked, apply a high-pass filter to the graphs at 300Hz.  High pass filtering is useful to eliminate DC offsets from the displayed input signal.  Note that the filter is not applied to the data as it is saved to disk, only to the data that appears on-screen.</p>

  </p>
  <p align="left"><U><strong>Fast Settle </strong></U></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> This button is only clickable in Intan/MUX acquisition mode.  Clicking it resets the Intan by setting the DO control line low and then high again.  See the '<a href="#Configuring">Configuring an Acquisition</a>' section for more information on the DO control line or fast settle time parameters.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"> Manually open/close the data file.  When this box is unchecked, the data file is closed and no data is being saved to disk.  When it is checked, the data file is (re)opened and data is being saved to disk.  Note that re-opening the same data file repeatedly overwrites it each time it is reopened.  You may also type a data file name into the line-edit next to this checkbox to change the save file name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">What you put into a data file should be what you get back.  Additionally, errors in a data file should be detectible and optionally correctible.  Two mechanisms exist to help ensure that the data you put in is what you get back.  The SHA1 sum detects errors, and the PAR2 redundancy files can help repair errors.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><U><a name="SHA1">SHA1 	Sum</a></U> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"> Each data file has an 	SHA1 sum that is saved in its .meta file.  This checksum is useful 	for verifying the data file's integrity.  If the SHA1 sum of a data 	file differs from the sum computed at save time, then the file is 	known to be corrupt.  (Conversely, if the sum validates ok, then 	there is nearly certain probability that the file is not corrupt).  	Use the <strong><em>Tools → Verify SHA1... </em></strong>menu 	option to verify a previously-saved data file's SHA1 sum.</p>

    <p align="left"><a name="PAR2"> <U>PAR2 Redundancy Tool</U></a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">PAR2 stands for Parity ARchive 2.  It is a file format popularized by Usenet binary distributors to help detect and correct errors in data files.  The workflow for using PAR2 is as follows: One creates PAR2 files to go along with one or more data files.  Then, at some point in the future if the data files (and/or the PAR2 files) become corrupt, it is possible to detect and correct errors in the data files (up to the redundancy percentage specified at PAR2 creation time). </p>
      <p align="left">For example, if you have a file named data.bin, and you wanted to be able to correct for up to 5% loss of data (corruption) in that file, you would use the PAR2 redundancy tool to create a set of PAR2 files to go along with data.bin, specifying 5% redundancy.  The size of the PAR2 files produced will be roughly 5% of the original data.bin.  If one has the PAR2 files on hand in the future, then up to 5% corruption can occur in data.bin, and it can be reconstructed given the corrupt data.bin and the PAR2 redundancy files.  Disk space is essentially traded-off for redundancy and decreased probability of permanent data loss.</p>
      <p align="left"> To create PAR2 archives and/or verify/repair data using PAR2 files, use the built-in redundancy tool GUI available in the <strong><em>Tools → PAR2 Redundancy Tool </em></strong>menu option.</p>
